Why am I writing this blog, and why should you care?

On my computer right now I have a folder named workspaces that
contains 50 different files and folders. Primarily, each of these represents a
project that deals with data science, compurter science, or retro
programming. But up until now these projects have all been personal
projects that only I know about.

In the last month or so, I stumbled upon the german word
_zettelkasten_ which is a method of creating and storing notes. It
catagorizes notes into fleeting notes, literary notes, and permanent
notes. Briefly, fleeting notes are one word or phrase notes meant as
reminders; literary notes are notes taked while reading texts, and
permanent notes are notes written in your own words about a specific
topic. In my life, I believe I have taken good fleeting notes,
reasonable literary notes, and lousy permanent notes. It occured to me
then that if I am going to writter better permanent notes, written in
my own words, why not make them public?

So that's why I am writing this blog. It gives me an opportunity to
share my notes as a learn more about my favorite subjects.

___Why should you care?___

A fair ask. And to be honest one that I did not fully consider when I
started thinking about this blog. But data science is a hot topic
right now, so take a look at the data science posts. I'm sure you will see
something of interest. Perhaps an explanation of something that you
have struggled with, or some code you can use in your own
projects. Also review the computer science posts. Computer science is
quickly becoming a classical subject of study similar to mathematics
and physics. You may never need to write your own sorting algorithm
but an exploration of sorting alogithms might lead to insight into how
to organize your own code and data for higher efficieny and understanding.

Sprinkled throughout this blog, you will find retro
programming. Sometimes in the form of standalone posts and sometimes
as example code used to illustrate a point within a post. The
illustrations are mean to provide "nuts and bolts" examples of how
something works. You see, modern programming languages almost always
provide facilities for doing low-level processing. For instance if you
need to multiply two matrices together, Python has sevaral
[libraries](https://realpython.com/linear-programming-python/) for doing
just that. But if we choose a retro programming language like Atari
BASIC, we need to do it from scratch, which is a good first principles
learning experience. Sort of like learning to do long division by
hand - good to know how it works; but not something you want to do
often.
