  <title>Getting Started with Hatari</title>

<h1>Hatari</h1>

<p>Hatari is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_ST">Atari ST</a>
 emulator available for MacOS, Windows, and Unix
operating systems. You can download Hatari from <a href="hatari.tuxfamily.org">
hatari.tuxfamily.org</a>. The latest version as of August 17, 2022 is version 
<a href="https://download.tuxfamily.org/hatari/2.4.1/">1.4.1</a>. I am using a
Mac so all that follows will be oriented towards MacOS.</p>

<h1>Configuration and Media Folder</h1>

<p>To store Hatari configuration files and media files like floppy disk images
let's create a folder and name it Hatari. Create the folder in a convenient 
place such as inside your home directory or on your desktop. Inside the
Hatari folder let's create a cfg and a tos folder. Our Hatari folder should 
look like this:

<pre>
~/Hatari/
    cfg/
    tos/
</pre>

<h1>TOS</h1>

<p>Like the Atari ST computer, Hatari requires a version of 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_TOS">The Operation
System (TOS)</a>. To start with we will use 
<a href="https://emutos.sourceforge.io">emutos</a> which is a free and modern
version of TOS. You can download emutos at 
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/emutos/files/emutos/1.2.1">
sourceforge.net</a>. The latest version as of August 16, 2022 is 
version 1.2.1. There are several versions available but the one we want is 
emutos-1024k-1.2.1. Once download, unzip the file into the tos 
folder. This should create a sub-folder named emutos-1024k-1.2.1. 
Inside that folder, we will use the etos1024k.img file as our TOS.
</p>

<h1>Initial Configuration File</h1>

<p>On my Mac Hatari likes to use <b>~/Library/Application Support/Hatari</b> 
as the default folder for configuration files. I don't find this
particularly convient, so I created an alias to the <b>cfg</b> folder and
put it in the default folder. I then created an alias to the default folder and
put it in the <b>~/Hatari</b> folder. This way I can easily move between
the folders when necessary</p>

<p>Hatari keeps its configurations in files with a <b>.cfg</b> prefix. We
could create a configuration file by hand, but a better way is through the
configuration UI built into Hatari. On my Mac, I can get to the configuration
settings by pressing COMMAND-, (the usual shortcut to get to preferences). 
There is also a configuration UI accessible by pressing the F12 key. On the
Mac the preferences are divided into ten tabs: Disks, Rom, Atari Screen,
Display, Sound, System, Joysticks, Keyboard, Peripheral, and Other. Let's
take a look at each tab and make changes to setup Hatari to emulate a base
model Atari Mega STE with 4 megabytes of RAM.</p>

<h2>Disks</h2>

<p>Let's enable both Drive A and B, and make them both double sided. We can
also select <b>Auto insert B</b>, which might come in handy later. 
Now let's create an <b>fd</b> folder in our <b>~/Hatari</b> folder 
and set  <b>Default images location</b> to point to that directory. We will
set up hard disks at a later time.</p>

<p><a href="IMG/CFG1/DISKS.HTM">Disk panel image</a></p>

<h2>ROM</h2>

<p>Set <b>TOS Image</b> to point to the etos1024k.img file downloaded 
earlier. The Cartridge image setting can be left empty.</p>

<p><a href="IMG/CFG1/ROM.HTM">ROM Panel image</a></p>


<h2>Atari Screen</h2>

<p>Set <b>Monitor</b> to <b>RGB</b> to emulate an Atari color monitor. We will
start out with a color monitor switching betweeb low and medium resolution. 
We can also use a Mono monitor for productivity applications when necessary,
though it does require a restart.</p>

<p><a href="IMG/CFG1/ASCREEN.HTM">Atari screen panel image</a></p>

<h2>Display</h2>

<p>We can keep these setting as is for now, though we may need to tweak them 
for performance reasons later.</p>

<p><a href="IMG/CFG1/DISPLAY.HTM">Display panel image</a></p>

<h2>Sound</h2>

<p>No changes needed</p>

<h2>System</h2>

<p>Since we want to configure a basic Atari Mega STE with 4 megabytes of
memory, use the following settings:</p>

<p><b>Machine Type:</b>  Mega STE</p>
<p><b>CPU:</b>  68000 at 16 MHz</p>
<p><b>FPU:</b>  None</p>
<p><b>ST RAM Size:</b>  4 Mib</p>

<p><a href="IMG/CFG1/SYSTEM.HTM">System panel image</a></p>

<h2>Joysticks</h2>

<p>No changes needed.</p>

<h2>Keyboard</h2>

<p>For the best compatibility I change the Keyboard mapping to 
<b>Scancode</b>. With this setting the tilde (~) and the backslash (\) keys 
are reversed, but all other keys are mapped correctly.</p>

<p><a href="IMG/CFG1/KEYBOARD.HTM">Keyboard panel image</a></p>

<h2>Peripheral</h2>

<p>No changes.</p>

<h2>Other</h2>

<p>No changes.</p>
