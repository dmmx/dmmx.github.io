	<p>Today I start a new blog to talk about the projects I am working
	on. There was actually a first attempt using Jekyll, but that was getting
	to hard to maintain. Jekyll is build on Ruby, and ruby on the Mac was
	getting to hard to keep up to date. Maybe I'll futz with it later.
	Eventually I would like to use a static site generator, but for now it
	is static html pages.
