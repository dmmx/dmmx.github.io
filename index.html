	<h2>Publishing Workflow 0.1</h2>
	<pre>2023-05-29</pre>
	<p>First thing I want to establish in a basic, minimal, publishing workflow
	for my blog. Writing will be done on Hatari, an Atari ST emulator. The 
	writing tools will vary, but to start I'll use the QED text editor to write
	the HTML pages and the CAB web browser to preview them. This is a nice 
	combination because I configured QED to be the source viewer in CAB.
	This gives me the ability to launch QED from CAB and then edit pages, close
	QED, and review the pages before publication. To get started publication
	involves simply converting the filenames to lowercase, changing the
	extension from .htm to .html, and then copying the files from the BLOG
	folder where the souce files are stored to the dmmx.github.io folder
	where the git repo for the blog resides. I can then run the git commands
	to publish the blog from there. The lowercase, extension conversion, and
	copy are all done from the host computer.

	<h2>Beginning Again</h2>
	<pre>2023-05-29</pre>
	<p>Today I start a new blog to talk about the projects I am working
	on. There was actually a first attempt using Jekyll, but that was getting
	to hard to maintain. Jekyll is build on Ruby, and ruby on the Mac was
	getting to hard to keep up to date. Maybe I'll futz with it later.
	Eventually I would like to use a static site generator, but for now it
	is static html pages.
