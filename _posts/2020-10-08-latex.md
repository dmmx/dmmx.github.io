# Bookmarks

Strangely, it all started with bookmarks. You see at home and at work
I have a lot of browser bookmarks. Hundreds in fact. This situation
was getting out of hand. I would bookmark pages that I had already
booked marked, sometime two or three years previously. But I couldn't
tell when I had booked mark something nor could I tell if I had a
bookmark that could help with my current research. So I wanted to find
a better way.

# Latex

On a Mac, download MacTeX from here:
https://tug.org/mactex/

This stall is over 6 GB so it takes a bit of storage.

The install comes with a 125 page book _"The Not So Short Intoduction
to LateX2e"_, but is stored in the /usr/local directory which makes it
a little hard to find. So I saved a duplicate to a working directory.

The `/Library/TeX/texbin/` contains around 450 file, many of them
executables but `latex` seems to be the main one. 

Here is an example of using latex to create a pdf:

```
latex sample.tex
```



# Bibtex

[Bibtex](http://www.bibtex.org) is away of managing bibliographic data for LatTeX
documents. For the Mac there is program called
[BibDesk](https://bibdesk.sourceforge.io) for managing Bibtex files.

Here is a small Latex document the included a bibliography.
```latex
\documentclass[11pt]{article}
\usepackage{cite}

\begin{document}

\title{My Article}
\author{Nobody Jr.}
\date{Today}
\maketitle

Blablabla said Nobody ~\cite{Nobody06}.

\bibliography{sample}{}
\bibliographystyle{plain}
\end{document}
```

And these are the commands to process the document into a pdf.

```bash
latex sample.tex 
bibtex sample.aux
latex sample.tex
latex sample.tex
```

This is the same as the direction from the bibtex website, except I
had to run `bibtex sample.aux` instead of simply `bibtex
sample.tex`. I think the `.tex` extension made the difference.



## Bibtex and EMACS

Emacs includes a [bibtex-mode](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/BibTeX)
for editing bibtext files.

There is also an [ebib](http://joostkremers.github.io/ebib/) package
that looks promising.

I also think there might be some facilities through org-mode for
managing bibliographies. See
[org-ref](https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref).
