title: "Linear Programming Meets BASIC"

Linear progamming and linear algebra underpin many of the algorithms used today in machine learning and other complex computer applications. Linear algebra mainly deals with linear equations, while linear programming deals mainly with linear inequalities. Of particular interest is the use of linear programming to optimize a linear function.

In this series of posts we will explore linear algebra and linear programming using Atari BASIC as our guide. Atari Basic provides very little support for LA or LP, so we will need to roll up our sleeves and start from scratch. 

Here is the lists of posts in this series:
